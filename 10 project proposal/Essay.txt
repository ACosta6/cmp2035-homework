There's always that thought in your mind of whether or not you are able to introduce yourself to someone through your art. Is it possible for a person to get to know you by seeing your work? Will they understand your style, and who you are? I remember when I was in third grade, and had experienced my first real enjoyment of creation. I remember being so young and so happy that I had spent the time and process on painting a real canvas. My teacher loved the work and had asked me if she could put it up with the other fantastic art from every grade. I was elated. It was on display for an event that night, and had even gotten in the newspaper! She loved what I had created and motivated me to create more from that point on. She understood me. 
Through creating a personal portfolio of my own work on this website, I hope to promote to future employers and colleagues a better understanding of who I am, and the skills I possess. The site should feel confident, and proud of what is within it. I would like to be able to have an outlet to showcase my work whenever I create something new and easy ways for me to share it. Making this site would mean I could have a place for multiple folders named after the type of projects being created. The pieces would be in depth, with a synopsis of who the client was and what we were aiming to achieve. Whenever someone would like to give feedback on a piece or share it, they will have an open form to enter in their thoughts, and a share button to send it to various social media. Through this site, I hope to bridge a gap between people understanding me and my creative direction.
